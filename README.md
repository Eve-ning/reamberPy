# Reamber (Py)

**Status: Development in Progress**

**Requires Python >=3.7**

`pip install reamber==0.0.20`

`pip install reamber==0.1.5`

*see what's the difference below!*

------

This is a simple package to handle VSRG files, useful if you'd want to manipulate data
such as offset, column, bpm, etc.

This doesn't provide complex algorithms, only the base dataclasses and helpful basic
algorithms

# Migrating to >v0.1.1 Releases

Migrating to `>0.1.1` means spending time updating **a lot** of names.

Major changes in `0.1.1` include many differences in naming. 
Only update it if you don't plan mind spending time refactoring.

# For Developers

Note that this is still in alpha stage, means a lot of things aren't settled down
yet. In other words, many function names and references will change without notice.

It is recommended to only build scratch/temp files if you want to utilize this library

# Motivation

A growing amount of osu!mania players are becoming interested in programming.
The best way to learn is to relate it to something that you're familiar with.
That's why I'm making a library for most common VSRG (Vertical Scrolling Rhythm Game)
types.
