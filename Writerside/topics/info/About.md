# About ReamberPy

## Purpose

ReamberPy is a universal VSRG Python Library for developers.

## Design Considerations

I made this library with ease of coding in mind. I believe that regardless of
a developer's ability, it should be easy and intuitive to pick up.

That's why:

- All objects are sufficiently documented.
- Type-Hinting is extensively enforced, so all up-to-date IDEs can instantly 
  suggest the next step.
- The package is as simply structured as possible, making further development
  easy.
