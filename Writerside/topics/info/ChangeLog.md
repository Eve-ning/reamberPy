# Changelog

Note: In the future, the minor changelog will be moved to
the [GitHub Release page](https://github.com/Eve-ning/reamberPy/releases).
Major changes will still be documented here.

## 1.0.0

- No significant change here, just finalizing the library

## 0.2.1

- Update documentation to use **JetBrains' WriterSide**.

## 0.1.6

**Major**

- Refactored many parts of the package to make it more maintainable.
    - Discontinued support for SV Package

- Added CI/CD
- Improved Testing
- Improved Documentation
- Simplify Replay Error parsing
    - Errors are calculated from the minimum distance instead of simulation of
      play
    - Wrap returns in Dataclasses to improve structuring

- _Honestly too many things I've fixed_

## 0.1.5

- Fix osu! default DataFrames not being created due to assumption of inputs
  being non-empty.

## 0.1.4

- Fix `OsuHit` & `OsuHold` rendering with decimals, breaking map loading.

## 0.1.3

- Fix `OsuSv` and `OsuBpm` sometimes outputting badly formatted TimingPoints,
  causing osu! not to load

## 0.1.2

- Fix Rates not working with empty `OsuMap` samples
- Fix Rates not changing BPM

## 0.1.1

Simply fixes the .pyi not being uploaded.

## 0.1.0

**Major**

Massive changes to codebase, from naming schemes, architecture and flexibility.
The full release notes can be found
in the GitHub Release.

- Changed `CamelCase` to `snake_case`
- Revamped how values can be modified, more easily understood with 
  **Stacking**.
- Dropped `inplace`
- Data storage is now using `pd.DataFrame` and `pd.Series`, so it's easier
  to upscale.
- Dropped `@dataclass` for non-map classes in favor of custom props.
- Less-used and hard-to-maintain algorithms are dropped.
- Tests are now more extensive, allowing me to have a more stable codebase

**Minor**

- Some plural names are converted to singular for consistency with the property
  type name.
- Dropped Dummy Class
- Add basic osu! Replay Parsing with `osrparse==5.0.0`

## 0.0.20

- Fix issue with rates breaking #36
- Add reading from string for all types
- Fix BMS BPM integer issue #20

## 0.0.19

- Fixes minor bugs in `OsuAPI`
- Add failsafe for missing `Qua` Multiplier loading
- Add failsafe for bad `Osu` value/code loading

## 0.0.18

- Add `OsuAPIV1` and `OsuAPIV2`

## 0.0.17

- Add `sv_osu_measure_line_md` Multidimensional SV generation.
- Add SV Collapsing Support. SVs close enough will now be merged.
- Remove old info about **SDF** in SV Primer
- Fix issue with negative Y in SV Generation causing incorrect error mitigation
- Attempt fixing `OsuToSM` and `SMToOsu` interconversion offset issue (
  again).

## 0.0.16

- Add `BMS` Support
- Attempt fixing `OsuToSM` and `SMToOsu` interconversion offset issue.
- `Map.read_file("path.map")` is now static. e.g. Initialization is
  now `m = OsuMap.read_file("path.osu")`

## 0.0.15

- Add `Dummy` class
- Add `PlayField` API for new `Pattern` package.
- Implement `reamber.algorithms.pattern` package.
- Convert all `Hold` classes to have a separate `HoldTail` class.
    - All `Hold` classes now have to initialize with `_length` instead
      of `length`. However, length is still an
      accessible property

- Drop `Obj` Suffix for most classes
- Deprecate `analysis` package for in-built base class functions
- Create `plot` package for plotting only
- Move HitsoundCopy to under `stack`, deprecate `meta`
