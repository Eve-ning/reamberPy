# About ReamberPy

## Purpose

The ultimate purpose is to provide a simple, accessible interface for Vertical Scroll Rhythm Game (VSRG) Python
developers and aspiring Python learners.

## Promises (I try to make)

I made this library with ease of coding in mind. I believe that regardless of ability, it should be easy and
intuitive to pick up. That's why the following:

- All objects, if not easily understood are documented as much as required.
- Extensive use of type-hinting, so all up-to-date IDEs can instantly hint the next step.
- The package is as simply structured as possible, making further development easy.

## Contributing

You are absolutely free to suggest any improvements in the GitHub Issues page.

I'm currently solo developing this package because of high structure volatility, that is, I'd like to have full creative
control of layout before pushing it out to community development.

The reason for that is because I also aim to learn the ins and outs of developing a *good* package. I believe that I
learn more of the whys and hows by failing.
